## Check Point CloudGuard Auto Scaling on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start deploys an Auto Scaling group of Check Point CloudGuard Security Gateways to protect a web service.

Check Point CloudGuard for AWS extends comprehensive enterprise-grade security, including zero-day threats protection, deep packet HTTPS inspection, intrusion prevention system (IPS), and complete application and identity awareness, to the AWS Cloud. It protects assets in the cloud from attacks while enabling secure connectivity, and lets you enforce consistent security policies across your entire organization.

When you deploy the Quick Start, you can choose to include load balancers, web servers, and a preconfigured Security Management Server to manage the Security Gateways. The deployment is automated by AWS CloudFormation templates and takes about 30 minutes. 

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying CloudGuard Auto Scaling into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying CloudGuard Auto Scaling into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
